Ionic Drupal Demo - Frontend
============================

This is a demo showing how you might integrate Drupal 8 and the Ionic Framework to build a very simple mobile app.  

Presentation slides can be found here: http://nyccamp.org/session/building-mobile-apps-using-ionic-and-apache-cordova

This is the front end of the application.  It uses the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/), which brings in turn leverages [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

To get started with this application, clone the project down.  Make sure you have Ionic [installed on your local machine](http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/installation.html).  Then run one of the following commands:

```
ionic serve # Opens a browser to the application and live-reloads as you work.
ionic emulate # Opens an emulator for iOS/Android depending on your project settings.
```
# ionic-foodmet
